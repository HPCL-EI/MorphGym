# About Embodied Gym

Embodied Gym is a project that provides an API for jointly optimizing agents' morphology and policy
 in various environments. All settings are based on [Issac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), which provides a GPU pipline for 
 parallel simulation and training.
 
This platform supports standard two-level optimization framework, as well as other novel approaches like RL.
 The API is like [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) but more suitable for Embodied Intelligence.



```python
import morphgym

world = morphgym.make('Dog-2D')
agent = world.agent

morph = agent.morph_space.sample() # this is where you would insert your morphology
agent.set_morph(morph)

observation, info = world.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    action = agent.action_space.sample()  # this is where you would insert your policy
    observation, reward, terminated, info = world.step(action)

    world.reset_idx(terminated)
    world.render()

world.close()
```
